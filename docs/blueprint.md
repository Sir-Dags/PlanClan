- Background color: Light pastel gray (#F0F0F0), visibly related to the lavender yet subtle, creating a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted blue (#A9CCE3), which is analogous to lavender and contrasts well, can highlight important actions and notifications.
- Font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text. It offers a modern and slightly warm appearance, which suits a family calendar.
- Use clear, minimalist icons for event types and family members to aid quick recognition.
- Maintain a clean, card-based layout to display events, family member assignments, and tasks. This improves readability.
- Incorporate clean and subtle transitions when navigating between dates, adding events, and as a whole to provide a smooth user experience.
